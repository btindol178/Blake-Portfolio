# Project 1:Analysis of Florida sea level raising at an exponential rate.
  - Goals of project 1:
      - 1) Download water level data for different stations around florida at an 15 minute increment and aggregate to daily level of granularity
      - 2) Project with the CAGR from data on the last 10 years using exponential formula to see where water level will be at in 100 years.
      - 3) Visualize what areas will be affected in St.Petersburg FL area to see if it will be worth it to buy a house now.
